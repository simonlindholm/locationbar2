Fork of the [Locationbar² Firefox extension](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/locationbar²/), modified to work slightly better in modern Firefox versions.

It has one new feature: on a URL like a?b#c, you can click the ?b and #c parts.

It's still pretty buggy, and I'm not planning to maintain it.
